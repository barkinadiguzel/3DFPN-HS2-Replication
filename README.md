# 3DFPN-HS2-Replication
3DFPN-HS2-Replication is a minimal implementation of a 3D Feature Pyramid Network combined with a High Sensitivity and Specificity (HS²) network for pulmonary nodule detection. It demonstrates candidate detection and false positive reduction on 3D CT volumes without full training or testing pipelines.
